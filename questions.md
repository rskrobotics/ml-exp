# Questions for KN

1. Preprocessing of the data - when do you decide? How often log processing is used?
2. Info about the datasets - 36% is crappy. What do we do about that? 
3. How do you handle time offsets? Say a process with huge inertia?
4. How do you handle catastrophic events? Say that something breaks totally?
5. How do you know when model fits, and when it does not generalize well? How do you measure that?
6. Lagged features - how do you make sense out of that? You can't control just one knob and hope that it will work. The variables are interconnected.
